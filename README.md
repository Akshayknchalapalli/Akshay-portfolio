## Project Overview

This portfolio website is designed to showcase my skills, projects, and personal information in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. It includes several sections such as Home, About, Skills, Services, Projects, Contact, and a Footer. The content for each section is dynamically generated from a text file (`Text Responsive Portfolio Website.txt`) and styled using CSS. Additionally, JavaScript is used to enhance interactivity.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:


- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the website.
- `Assets/`
    - `img/`: A directory containing image assets used in the website.
    - `css/`
         - `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the website.
    - `js/`
      -    `main.js`: The JavaScript file for adding interactivity and functionality to your portfolio website.
      -    `scrollreveal.min.js`: The JavaScript source code for the ScrollReveal library, version 4.0.9. This library is commonly used for creating scroll animations and revealing elements as the user scrolls down a webpage.
- `Text Responsive Portfolio Website.txt`: A text file containing the content for various sections.
